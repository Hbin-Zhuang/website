Building this website was both a technical challenge and a creative outlet. As someone who spends most of their time working with **Vue** and **Nuxt**, I wanted to explore something different while still leveraging familiar technologies. Here's how it all came together.

## The Tech Stack

**Astro + Vue + UnoCSS** â€“ This might seem like an unusual combination, but each choice was deliberate:

### Why Astro?
Coming from a **Nuxt** background, I was intrigued by Astro's **islands architecture**. The ability to have zero JavaScript by default, with selective hydration only where needed, appeals to my performance-focused mindset. Plus, being able to use **Vue components** within Astro means I didn't have to abandon my favorite framework entirely.

### Vue Integration
While this is primarily a static site, I still wanted the reactivity and component structure that **Vue** provides. The homepage showcases some interactive elements that benefit from Vue's reactive system, and it felt natural to continue using the framework I know best.

### UnoCSS for Styling
After working extensively with various CSS frameworks, **UnoCSS** has become my go-to choice. Its **on-demand** nature means smaller bundle sizes, and the **atomic CSS** approach aligns perfectly with how I think about component styling. The fact that it integrates seamlessly with **Vite** (which powers Astro) was the cherry on top.

## Development Experience

The development workflow has been incredibly smooth:
- **Vite's** hot reload makes iteration fast
- **TypeScript** support out of the box provides the type safety I'm used to
- **ESLint** configuration keeps the code clean and consistent

## Performance Considerations

Every technical decision was made with performance in mind:
- **Astro's SSG** generates lightweight, fast-loading pages
- **UnoCSS** only includes the CSS that's actually used
- **Selective hydration** keeps JavaScript payloads minimal
- **Modern web fonts** (Inter & IBM Plex Mono) with proper loading strategies

## AI-Powered Development

I'd be remiss not to mention how **AI tools** shaped this project. **Cursor** has been invaluable for rapid prototyping and refactoring, while **LLM APIs** helped me explore different architectural patterns before settling on the final approach.

## What's Next?

This website serves as both a portfolio and a playground for experimenting with new technologies. As I continue exploring **React** and advancing my **AI development** skills, I plan to add more interactive features and perhaps experiment with **edge computing** for dynamic content.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hbin-zhuang) if you're curious about the implementation details or want to see how everything fits together.
