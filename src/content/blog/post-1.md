Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm HBin Zhuang, a front-end engineer passionate about exploring the ever-evolving world of web development. After years of building applications with **Vue**, **Nuxt**, and diving deep into **micro-frontend architectures**, I finally decided to create a space where I can share my journey, insights, and the things I'm learning along the way.

## Why This Blog?

As someone who has worked extensively with **low-code platforms** and modern build tools like **Vite** and **Webpack**, I've always been fascinated by how technology can simplify complex problems. This blog is my attempt to document that journey â€“ from the technical challenges I encounter in my day-to-day work to the exciting possibilities I see emerging in the **AI space**.

## What You'll Find Here

I plan to share insights about:
- **Frontend architecture** and best practices
- My experiences with **Vue ecosystem** and the transition to **React**
- **AI-powered development** tools like **Cursor** and **LangChain**
- **DevOps practices** with Docker, Nginx, and CI/CD pipelines
- Personal projects and experiments

## The Journey Ahead

2025 feels like a pivotal year. With AI transforming how we write code and the frontend landscape constantly evolving, there's never been a more exciting time to be a developer. I'm particularly excited to explore the **React ecosystem** more deeply and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible with **AI-assisted development**.

Whether you're here for the technical content or just curious about my journey, I'm glad you stopped by. Let's learn and build amazing things together!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect â€“ you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/hbin-zhuang) or drop me an email.
